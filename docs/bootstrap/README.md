# Bootstrap inputs

The client input files a clean install of MAICC-IFRS9 is bootstrapped from, committed so that a
server builds the whole EIR data foundation without an external file (spec v4, section 6.11).
The committed copy is read first; a OneDrive path is only a local fallback.

| Folder | What | Loaded by |
|---|---|---|
| `ebanker-pack-2026-10-07/` | The 18 follow-up extracts of 7 October 2026 and the 5 afternoon queries: the ledger, masters, rates, PLR, charges, loan-book history, balance history, charts, plans, schedules, status history, daily accrual | `eir:bootstrap` step 3 (route 1 pack into the landing zone) |
| `data-dictionary-2026-10-06/` | The 24 data-dictionary results of 6 October 2026 (tables, columns, keys, schemes, codes, row counts, samples) | reference; `DD_09` schemes read for product names |
| `takeon/` | The take-on amortisation schedules mapped to E-Banker accounts, with the fee columns for Finance | `eir:bootstrap` step 4 (take-on build) |
| `trial-balances/monthly/` | The 20 monthly trial balances, January 2025 to August 2026, as received from Finance | `eir:bootstrap` step 3 (landed as `ebanker_trial_balances`; the GL side of the reconciliation is derived from them) |
| `trial-balances/afs-bridge-2025-12/` | The December 2025 AFS bridge in its two received versions (19 Aug 2026, amounts as text; 10 Sep 2026, amounts numeric, the one that is loaded): final AFS TB, initial TB to the auditor, TB December 2025, final E-Banker TB mapped | step 3; sheet 'Final E-Banker TB Dec 2025' |
| `trial-balances/afs-mapping-2023-to-2026-08/` | Every GL line mapped to its audited-accounts category with year-end balances Dec 2023, Dec 2024, Dec 2025 and Aug 2026 | step 3; the category bridge to the audited accounts (F17) |
| `queries/` | The SQL that produced the pack, version 1 | the E-Banker Feed's query register |
| `manifest.json` | Every file with its query id, row count and SHA-256; the accepted exceptions the gates allow | the gates |

Every file is exactly as received. None is opened or re-saved in Excel. A replacement (for example the
workbook returned by Finance with the fees filled in) is a new file beside the old one and a new manifest
entry; nothing here is edited in place.

Dates in this first pack are m/d/yyyy, as the export tool wrote them; the gates parse that format for this
pack by its manifest, and ISO for every later pack produced with the RUN 0 session settings.
